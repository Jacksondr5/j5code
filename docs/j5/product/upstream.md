# J5 and upstream

J5 Code is a fork of T3 Code, and it stays one. Upstream builds the base product and J5 builds a fleet layer on top ([overview](overview.md)). The fork is only affordable if J5 keeps its changes to upstream few, deliberate, and recorded, because every change is carried through every upstream advance. The principle is [upstream owns its product](principles.md#upstream-owns-its-product). Where upstream is building toward J5's own areas is tracked separately, in the [upstream convergence watchlist](upstream-convergence.md).

## The three zones

Every change lands in one of three zones.

1. **J5's domain.** The areas in the [overview](overview.md), built in J5-owned code. J5's definitions and principles govern them.
2. **Code overlap.** J5 code has to be reached from, or placed inside, a file upstream owns, without changing what upstream's product does. This is a matter of process, and [`FORK.md`](../../../FORK.md) is the whole answer: put the J5 code in J5-owned files, keep the upstream edit to a small appended integration case, and record the case in the same PR.
3. **Product overlap.** A change to what upstream's product does, as a user or agent experiences it: overriding or suppressing upstream behavior, giving an upstream concept a different meaning, or extending an upstream area such as a provider adapter so that it serves a J5 feature. This is the person's decision.

The test for zone 3 is behavioral, not about code size. A one-line edit that makes an upstream control disappear is zone 3; a large J5 module reached through a one-line registry entry is zone 2.

## Deciding a product overlap

An agent whose work heads into zone 3 brings the person:

- **what upstream does today**, and why, if upstream says;
- **what J5 would do instead**;
- **the trade-offs**: what the person gains, what it costs to carry through upstream advances, and what breaks if upstream later changes the same area;
- **the alternatives**, which always include following upstream and saying "not supported here".

The default is to follow upstream. Where upstream's product is less capable than a J5 feature wants, the usual answer is that the J5 feature is not supported there, and a general fix is offered back upstream (tracked in the give-back backlog, [#276](https://github.com/Jacksondr5/j5code/issues/276)).

When the person approves a divergence, it is recorded below and its code gets its FORK.md cases. When the person declines, nothing is recorded here; the ruling lives on the issue or PR where it was made.

## The register of divergences

Every place J5 knowingly makes upstream's product behave differently, with the person's decision behind it. FORK.md is the code-level ledger; this is the product-level one. When upstream makes an entry unnecessary or J5 stops needing it, the entry moves to **Retired** at the end, keeping its ID and heading, with a line saying when and why, so references to it keep working. Gaps in J5's mobile app aren't divergences: mobile is catching up to web as its own effort, and what it lacks is recorded there, not here.

Each entry has an ID ("divergence D7"), which never changes and is never reused. Every entry answers the same questions, in the same order:

- **Upstream:** what T3 Code does.
- **J5:** what J5 does instead.
- **Why:** the problem J5 had with upstream's behavior, and why this answer.
- **Consequences:** what it costs, what to check at each upstream advance, and known gaps.
- **Decided:** who decided, when, and where it's recorded.

Letter codes in the Decided lines (SC2, QS1, AR3, and so on) are rulings recorded in `docs/j5/worklog/` or in the dogfood v0 plan (removed on 2026-09-29; it's in git history). Numbered decisions dated 2026-09-24 were made during that day's upstream advance, and decisions dated 2026-10-08 during the advance onto upstream `main`.

### Agents and orchestration

#### D1. Help is a Subagent, a Peer Agent, or a Crew

**Upstream:** the instructions every agent receives point it to `delegate_task` for help from another provider, or from a model its own subagent tool can't run, and to `t3_thread_launch` or `create_threads` to start new threads.

**J5:** agents are told about three shapes of help: a Subagent their own provider runs, a Peer Agent started with `spawn_agent`, and a Crew proposed with `propose_crew`. `delegate_task` is kept for three narrow cases: running a saved persona as a subagent, work on another provider that the person doesn't need to talk to directly, and, as upstream now says, a model the provider's own subagent tool can't run. A review that takes several rounds gets a new `delegate_task` call for each round.

**Why:** upstream's delegated child is "a Peer Agent in a Subagent costume": the person can't talk to it, yet it outlives the agent that started it. That is the awkward middle J5's vocabulary exists to remove. The Crew shape was added after an agent asked to "spawn a crew" made subagents instead, because nothing it had been told mentioned a Crew. Personas later gave `delegate_task` a purpose again: a persona needs a way to run as a subagent.

**Consequences:** upstream's launch and workspace guidance never reaches J5 agents. `spawn_agent` and Crew seats require their own workspace choice instead, with upstream's `existing_worktree` name and shape beside `shared` and `worktree`, and reuse upstream's ThreadLaunch to prepare a new worktree (#274). J5's text lives in its own server module. Upstream moved its text into a package that can't reach J5's code, so the provider adapters read J5's module instead of upstream's. Every upstream advance ports upstream's prompt changes into it by hand, and a test pins J5's wording. J5 takes upstream's own sections as upstream writes them: secrets, thread links, showing visuals, the browser, schedules, and the two `delegate_task` rules above. Pi is the exception: its extension reads upstream's package, so Pi agents get upstream's text, including guidance for tools J5 hides.

**Decided:** Jackson with Product, 2026-08-24 (ST1–ST5); the Crew shape on 2026-09-17; the persona route in Jackson's review of 2026-09-13, which partly reverses ST5; the text's new home and the sections taken from upstream by Jackson, 2026-10-08. Whether `delegate_task` stays at all is under discussion (#336). Recorded in FORK.md case 8 and the saved-agent mentions section.

#### D2. Agents see a fail-closed subset of upstream's MCP tools

**Upstream:** agents can send into another thread, interrupt it, wait on it, launch threads, and create threads in bulk. Every tool declares who may call it. Thread tools reach any thread in the environment, not only the caller's project. An agent outside the app can sign in to the MCP server and use the tools that don't need a calling thread.

**J5:** the raw send, interrupt, wait, launch and bulk-create tools are hidden from agents, with upstream's queue, project and environment writers. Everything else follows upstream: its access model, its reach across the environment (writes included), and its outside-agent sign-in as shipped. J5's own tools declare their access the same way, so the ones that act for a calling thread are refused to an outside agent by upstream's own check. J5 rewrites the few descriptions that would mislead J5 agents, and reviews every new upstream tool at each advance.

**Why:** J5 built its own versions of the hidden tools, integrated with J5's model: `send_message` and Exchanges instead of raw send, `stop_agent` instead of interrupt, and `spawn_agent` and `propose_crew` instead of launch. A raw send is communication the ledger can't see, so a reply that never comes stalls silently. Raw thread creation skips the placement a spawn records. Waiting on another thread blocks the turn that would receive that thread's news. The tools are hidden, not deleted, to keep the fork's edits small. J5 used to hold thread tools to the caller's project as upstream did; upstream dropped that rule and J5 had no reason of its own to keep it.

**Consequences:** upstream's toolkit stays compiled, with part of it unused. A test pins the exact tool list, so a tool upstream adds fails the build until someone reviews it; all ten that arrived on 2026-10-08 were admitted (HTML previews, `request_secret`, five more browser controls and pull-request watches). Each advance also checks J5's access declarations and re-reads upstream's descriptions. An outside agent has no identity in J5's ledger, so it can't send a ledger message or be addressed; giving it one is #498. `t3_pending_request_respond` and `t3_thread_configure` act on other threads under upstream's own checks, which settles #345 as "follow upstream". One J5 rule stays on top of upstream's: a Crew seat can't be archived alone (D13). Open gap: `t3_worktree_handoff` still points agents at a tool they can't use.

**Decided:** Jackson, 2026-08-29 (substrate session). Omitting bulk creation was a Director disposition (an agent role), 2026-08-31. Withdrawing `t3_thread_wait` was Bryant's decision, 2026-09-14. `delegate_task` returned after Jackson's review of 2026-09-13. Following upstream's access model, its environment-wide reach and its outside-agent sign-in, and admitting the ten new tools, is Jackson's decision of 2026-10-08. Recorded in FORK.md cases 2, 4 and 38.

#### D3. J5's tools are pre-approved on Codex and Claude only

**Upstream:** on Claude, upstream pre-approves all of T3's own MCP tools, except in a read-only sandbox, where only its read-only tools are allowed. Codex refuses every non-read-only MCP tool under approval policy `never`, which is the policy full-access mode sends.

**J5:** on Codex, J5 approves its own coordination tools one at a time, Playbook tools included. On Claude, it adds them to the read-only allowance. On every other harness, the provider may show its own MCP prompt once before the Crew roster card, and a read-only persona there can't propose a Crew.

**Why:** without the Codex approvals, `send_message`, `spawn_agent` and `propose_crew` all fail in full-access mode. The approvals are per tool, never server-wide, so worktree handoff, preview and scheduling keep Codex's own verdict. Making other harnesses skip their native prompt is adapter work, and adapters are upstream's. ACP has no trustworthy server identity in its permission request, and Cursor's SDK doesn't expose MCP approval at all. A read-only persona being blocked from proposing is acceptable, because proposing a Crew is enough of a write.

**Consequences:** every advance must keep the Codex and Claude additions and their exact-list tests. A general fix belongs upstream (#276). Crews AC5 must say the roster card is the only human step on Codex and Claude, not on every harness. Muse Code sits with the other non-priority harnesses: it arrives as upstream ships it and J5 does no work for it. Muse doesn't read a persona's instructions or the Crew-seat rule, and in full-access mode it approves tool calls itself.

**Decided:** Bryant built the approvals, 2026-09-10 to 2026-09-15. Jackson's ruling of 2026-09-26 (#233) kept them and limited them to Codex and Claude; Bryant accepted it by narrowing and merging #301 and closing #233 on 2026-09-29. Muse Code: Jackson, 2026-10-08. Recorded in FORK.md's saved-agent mentions section.

#### D4. Agent deliveries queue behind a running turn; Astra peers can steer

**Upstream:** a message sent to a busy thread steers the running turn when it can.

**J5:** a message from one agent to another waits until the receiver's turn ends. The exception is peer updates to a running Codex Astra turn, which arrive as steers.

**Why:** a peer owns nothing about another agent's turn, and upstream's steering was actively harmful. On Claude, a steer aborts the turn and makes the agent report that "the user doesn't want to take this action", a refusal the human never gave. On Cursor, it destroys the turn. The ruling expected this to fold back into upstream: J5 only changed the default value of upstream's own delivery setting, so that it would collapse if upstream shipped a queue option. Astra is built to take messages during work. Without the exception, a 36-minute Astra run worked from stale guidance because its peers' updates waited for the end.

**Consequences:** this changes when a message is admitted, not whether the model reads it. Queueing also removed an accidental way of freeing a stuck start, so a queued run's age became something the Fleet page shows. Each advance checks the outbox and follow-up behavior this depends on. Checked on 2026-10-08 against upstream `main`, it is still needed: upstream still steers whenever it can (Claude with `priority: "now"`, which cancels sibling tool calls), and has no Astra-specific or asynchronous delivery. **J5 wants to drop this divergence** and follow upstream's delivery once upstream can deliver a message to a running turn without aborting it (Claude) or restarting it (Cursor), and supports Astra's in-work messaging. Upstream's Stop holds a thread's queue, so a delivery to a stopped agent waits until someone resumes the thread. J5 doesn't guard a steer that races a Stop (D5, retired): a peer steer already in flight when the person presses Stop can occasionally wake an Astra agent, and the person stops it again.

**Decided:** Jackson with Product, 2026-09-03 (QS1); the Astra exception by Jackson, 2026-09-04. Recorded in FORK.md case 26.

#### D6. Native resume starts fresh only when the conversation is gone

**Upstream:** when resuming a provider conversation fails for any reason, it starts a new one, primed with a summary, without telling the person. Other failures to start a turn are retried and then fail the run visibly.

**J5:** a new conversation starts only when the provider reports the old one is gone, and the thread says so visibly. Any other resume failure is a visible error. The one other fresh start is deliberate: when an earlier history delivery to the provider is uncertain, J5 skips resume and starts fresh rather than risk a duplicated or half-applied history.

**Why:** a provider's native history can't be rebuilt from the app's transcript. A silent fresh start hands the agent a stranger's memory without anyone noticing. That happened once, after a Codex schema change, and the transfer recorded no error.

**Consequences:** each adapter has to report "conversation gone" for this to work: Codex and OpenCode do, Claude resumes lazily, and the others never report it. J5 follows upstream's retry-then-fail for every other start failure. This is the one exception: a resume failure that isn't "conversation gone" fails the run at once, with no retry and no fresh start. The rule sits on upstream's own start-failure path, and its two fields live in upstream's `provider-core` package, so it is now an edit to a package as well as to the server. Upstream appears to intend the fresh start, so the change offered back upstream (#276) has to argue for it. If upstream declines, the fallback position is a visible fresh start. Checked on 2026-10-08, it is still needed. **J5 wants to drop this patch** as soon as upstream starts fresh only when the provider reports the conversation is gone, and tells the person when it does; the give-back in #276 argues for exactly that.

**Decided:** Jackson, 2026-09-24 (#8), narrowing an earlier refuse-everything rule from 2026-09-04; kept on 2026-10-08 as the one exception to upstream's start-failure handling. Recorded in FORK.md's temporary patches.

### New threads

#### D12. Multi-model send is refused from a persona draft

**Upstream:** a draft can fan out to several models, each in its own thread.

**J5:** fanning out is refused from a persona draft.

**Why:** a persona pins one model, so fanning it out would run every thread on that same model.

**Consequences:** each advance checks that no fan-out path carries a persona.

**Decided:** 2026-09-24 (#7b), a merge-time decision made to let that day's advance proceed. How fan-out should really work in J5 is open (#338). Recorded in FORK.md case 19.

### Archive and lifecycle

#### D13. Archive warns with measured facts

**Upstream:** archiving asks for confirmation only if the person turned that setting on, and the confirmation is generic.

**J5:** when archiving would strand something, such as open asks, running work or Crews, the web dialog lists it, whatever that setting says. A failed read says "Couldn't check". A Crew seat can't be archived on its own from any door.

**Why:** archiving is where obligations get stranded, and cleanup that happens silently is how a fleet loses track of itself. The platform's job is to put the facts in front of whoever decides. Crews archive as a unit: a member's failure is usually recoverable by messaging it again, and a member that can't be recovered has probably contaminated its crewmates.

**Consequences:** the lone-seat refusal is on the server, so it covers every client, but it lets the archive through if the Crew store can't be read.

**Decided:** Jackson, 2026-08-29 (AR2, AR3); the Crew unit rule, Jackson with Product, 2026-08-21 (R14); the server-side seat refusal from Jackson's review of 2026-09-17. Recorded in FORK.md cases 21, 22 and 37.

#### D14. A Crew follows its Captain

**Upstream:** archive, unarchive, settle and unsettle each touch one thread.

**J5:** archiving or deleting a Captain retires its live Crews. Unarchiving it brings back the Crews that retired with it. Settling it settles its seats, except those upstream's own auto-settle would leave alone because they're still working or waiting on the person. Unsettling it unsettles the seats that were settled.

**Why:** a Crew without its Captain has no one to report to, and the interface would need a place to show it. Before archive cascaded, sidebar archives of Captains stranded sixteen seats. Settle keeps upstream's meaning: a finished run is not a settled seat, but a settled Captain carries its seats with it.

**Consequences:** a Crew restore that stops partway is repaired by hand, by archiving and unarchiving the Captain again. Unarchiving doesn't bring back interrupted runs or dropped Exchanges. Snooze doesn't cascade. The seat rule follows upstream's auto-settle rule as upstream changes it; a dev server a seat left running no longer keeps it from settling. One exception: a seat that opted out of auto-settle is still settled with its Captain, because the person settled the Captain on purpose. Upstream's settle-time project script runs once for each seat that settles. Stopping a Crew sends upstream's Stop to each seat, which holds that seat's queue.

**Decided:** archive and delete follow the Crew unit rule (R14) and were built on 2026-09-15. Jackson ratified the rest on 2026-09-26 (#312). The opt-out exception, the per-seat script and upstream's Stop for Crews are Jackson's decisions of 2026-10-08. Recorded in FORK.md case 21.

### Timeline, composer, and plans

#### D16. Agent-to-agent messages render as cards

**Upstream:** a message delivered from another agent appears as if the person had typed it, with only a raw envelope tag to tell it apart.

**J5:** incoming and outgoing agent messages render as cards, as prominent as a user message, naming the sender and linking to its thread. They stay out of the conversation minimap, and queued rows name their sender.

**Why:** the person is a first-class reader of every agent-to-agent message and should see it in the normal flow without hunting. A first, quieter design made the messages hard to spot, so they were made prominent. The minimap tracks the person's own prompts, and agent messages there were noise.

**Consequences:** the seams in the timeline are small, but each advance checks the row and minimap hooks. Sent-message cards recognize only Codex and Claude tool records; other providers keep generic rendering. Upstream's in-thread find searches the cards' text. Upstream is still building out its own agent-to-agent features (see the [upstream convergence watchlist](upstream-convergence.md)), so its treatment of these messages may change. Check this entry at every upstream advance, and prefer upstream's treatment if it now meets the need.

**Decided:** Jackson, 2026-08-29 (TA1–TA5) and 2026-08-31 (TA6–TA8, including cards for sent messages). The minimap rule is from Jackson's PR #168 (2026-09-16). Sender labels on queued rows came from Jackson's dogfood findings (#42, #62), fixed on 2026-09-04. Recorded in FORK.md cases 7, 14 and 24.

#### D17. Plans are stored as artifacts and exported to `plan.md`

**Upstream:** a plan lives inline in the thread, with a download button.

**J5:** finalized plans are stored as project artifacts, and the latest is exported to `artifacts/plan.md`.

**Why:** plans were easy to lose in chat, couldn't be shared between agents, and a folder in the repository needed Git exclusions and could collide with tracked files.

**Consequences:** each finalized plan overwrites the project's one `plan.md`. The path form is undecided.

**Decided:** Tyler, who owns it, in PR #109 (2026-09-05); Jackson approved it on 2026-09-28. Recorded in FORK.md case 33.

#### D18. `@` offers saved personas first, and persona threads pin their model

**Upstream:** typing `@` in the composer opens a picker for referencing context in the message: files in the workspace and, in V2, other threads. Below the text box, the composer has a row of controls for the thread: the model picker (for example "Claude Opus 5.5"), reasoning effort, access mode (for example "Supervised"), and plan mode.

**J5:** `@` also lists saved personas, first, and picking one runs that persona. In a persona's thread, that whole row of controls is replaced by a chip naming the persona, because the persona fixes its own model, effort, and access, and the server rejects any change.

**Why:** Jackson typed `@scout` expecting a persona and got files (2026-09-13); Bryant made the picker list saved personas (2026-09-14). A persona's route is fixed and enforced by the server, so a thread's model picker would only produce failed sends. No reason is recorded for listing personas ahead of threads.

**Consequences:** the `@` menu and the controls row are edits to upstream's composer, one small addition per client. Each advance checks upstream's mention ordering and its composer controls, and personas route only to Codex and Claude.

**Decided:** the persona picker is Bryant's request (2026-09-08) and fix (2026-09-14). The persona model lock comes from Bryant's persona stack, whose scope was approved on 2026-09-08. The ordering against threads arrived in the 2026-09-24 advance (PR #262). Jackson approved it on 2026-09-28. Recorded in FORK.md's saved-agent mentions section and its PR #75–#86 table.

### Storage, install, and identity

#### D19. J5 never shares on-disk state with T3 Code

**Upstream:** T3 Code keeps its data in `~/.t3`, reads `T3CODE_HOME`, and uses a `.t3` folder in worktrees.

**J5:** it uses `~/.j5code`, `J5CODE_HOME`, and `.j5code`, with no fallback to T3's. J5 has its own desktop profiles and keeps its database in its own home. Its app ID (`codes.jackson.j5code`), URL scheme (`j5code`), CLI command (`j5`), and update URLs are its own.

**Why:** J5 and T3 Code must be able to run side by side on one machine without either reading or damaging the other's data, or taking the other's deep links, updates, or system registrations. Nothing in J5 points at upstream's infrastructure.

**Consequences:** some Linux integrations still collide with an installed T3 Code (#138), and many `T3CODE_*` variable names remain. One exception remains, to be removed: SSH transport still writes `~/.t3/ssh-launch` on remote hosts, kept only for npm-era remote servers that no longer exist (#339). Whether to rename the remaining `T3CODE_*` variables is open (#340).

The separate home is what keeps the two products' databases apart. J5 used to refuse a T3 Code database by its migration history as well; it no longer does, because upstream's own migrator now does the renumbering J5 used to bridge. Pointed at a T3 Code database on purpose, J5 would upgrade it. J5 does refuse its own databases from 0.0.43 or earlier, whose upgrade code is retired, with a message to run `j5 update 0.0.48` first.

One read of a T3 location is left in as upstream ships it: the desktop app looks for T3 Code's V1 desktop profile to carry local storage over. It imports nothing, because it takes only entries stored for the app's own address, which in J5 is `j5code://`.

Each advance checks for new upstream reads of `T3CODE_HOME` or `.t3` paths. The 2026-10-08 advance found them in the browser and trace CLI commands, the desktop launcher and the provider sign-in return links, and changed each to J5's.

**Decided:** Jackson, 2026-08-30 (DQ5, recorded on #33), 2026-09-02 (#68), 2026-09-24 (#1, #4), and 2026-10-08 (the history refusal retired; upstream's legacy local-storage import left in). The identifiers were settled in the fork setup plan (2026-08-15) and confirmed by Jackson on 2026-09-28. Recorded in FORK.md cases 15, 25, 31 and 41, and in `BRANDING.md`.

#### D20. J5 installs from its own release archives

**Upstream:** V2 ships self-contained release archives from upstream's own repository.

**J5:** J5 builds the same kind of archive from `Jacksondr5/j5code`, installs a `j5` command, and runs as `j5code.service` (`codes.jackson.j5code.service` on macOS). It hands over from the npm-era service only when that service is J5's.

**Why:** J5 followed upstream from npm to archives rather than keep npm alone. It publishes from its own repository so it never installs or updates T3 Code, and it renames the service so both can be installed at once.

**Consequences:** only darwin-arm64 and linux-x64 get releases, where upstream ships five platforms, and no reason for that is recorded. Other hosts build from source and get no `j5 update` or service. A real service handover, signing and notarization weren't verified when this shipped. Migration steps are in `docs/user/migrating-to-release-archives.md`. Windows releases are wanted (#341).

**Decided:** Jackson, 2026-09-24 (#3, #3a). Recorded in FORK.md cases 40 and 41.

#### D26. `j5 triage` investigates and files against J5's repository

**Upstream:** `triage` hands a misbehaving install to the person's coding agent with a playbook that clones `pingdotgg/t3code` at the installed version, searches and files issues there, and replaces itself with the copy on upstream's `main` when the two differ.

**J5:** the playbook clones, searches and files on `Jacksondr5/j5code`, refreshes from `j5/main`, and names the product J5 Code.

**Why:** J5's release tags don't exist upstream, so diagnosis ran against the wrong source, and J5-only problems would have been filed in upstream's tracker.

**Consequences:** `triagePrompt.ts`, `.github/triage/PLAYBOOK.md` and the `via-triage` issue template are edited in place, so each upstream advance merges upstream's playbook changes by hand. The repository needs the `via-triage` label. Releases installed before this change keep upstream's playbook.

**Decided:** Jackson, 2026-10-04, PR #446. Recorded in `BRANDING.md`.

#### D27. Usage telemetry reports to J5's PostHog project

**Upstream:** the server sends product usage events to upstream's PostHog project by default, and `T3CODE_TELEMETRY_ENABLED=false` turns them off.

**J5:** the same events, identifier and opt-out, sent to a PostHog project Jackson owns.

**Why:** J5 servers were reporting their users' usage to T3 Tools, which J5 has no agreement with and whose data Jackson can't see or delete. He wants the usage data himself, and J5's privacy page has to name who receives it.

**Consequences:** one default in `AnalyticsService.ts` differs, so each upstream advance checks the token is still J5's. Jackson is responsible for the data: the project discards client IP addresses, and J5's privacy page describes what is sent. Releases installed before this change keep reporting to upstream's project. There is no Settings toggle, only the environment variable. Upstream's welcome wizard now tells the person about the data; in J5 that sentence names J5 Code and links J5's privacy page.

**Decided:** Jackson, 2026-10-04. Recorded in `BRANDING.md`.

#### D21. Pair discovery stays inside a worktree

**Upstream:** `pair` is the CLI command that mints a one-time link for connecting a browser or the mobile app to a running server. When it finds no server in the current worktree, it falls back to the default install.

**J5:** in a linked worktree with no running server, `pair` refuses to fall back.

**Why:** during a dogfood test, an agent ran `pair` in its worktree before its server was up, and the fallback minted a real pairing token against the live install (#70). The isolation work (D19) exists so an isolated environment can never reach shared state by accident. A short bounded retry covers a server that hasn't finished starting (#67).

**Consequences:** the retry can be dropped if upstream gives the CLI a way to tell a server that is starting from one that isn't there. Each advance checks `pair`'s home resolution.

**Decided:** introduced in PR #94 (2026-09-04). Jackson approved it on 2026-09-28, closing the carry-or-drop question FORK.md's 2026-09-06 review left open. Recorded in FORK.md's final upstream-file review ("Pair discovery isolation and activation retry") and its `pair.ts` rows.

#### D25. The product is named J5 Code wherever a person or an agent reads it

**Upstream:** the app, its CLI output, error messages, agent instructions and tool titles say "T3 Code", tool rows and the mobile header show the T3 mark, and new worktree branches start with `t3/`, a prefix the person can change in Settings.

**J5:** all of that says "J5 Code" and shows the J5 mark, and new branches start with `j5code/`. Upstream's prefix setting is kept, with `j5code` as its default, and so is its fallback to a flat name (`j5code-<id>`) when a branch called `j5code` is in the way. Upstream's own services keep their names ("T3 Connect", "T3 Account"), as do protocol identifiers such as the `t3-code` MCP server. Documentation keeps upstream's wording.

**Why:** J5 and T3 Code can be installed side by side, and a person should always be able to tell which one they are looking at. The old name kept reappearing because the branding rules left general copy alone.

**Consequences:** these are literal edits in a few hundred upstream files, so every upstream advance has to rebrand the strings upstream added or changed; the grep is in [Merging upstream](../process/upstream-merge.md) and `BRANDING.md` lists what stays. Temporary branches named `t3/…`, `t3-…` or the older `t3code/…` are still recognized.

**Decided:** Jackson, 2026-10-04, PR #445; the branch prefix against upstream's new `t3/`, 2026-10-08. Recorded in `BRANDING.md`.

#### D28. The `j5` command

**Upstream:**

- **The executable.** Each release archive's executable is `t3`, and the `t3` command on `PATH` links to it.
- **Updates.** Only `t3 update` moves that link. An update from the app leaves the command on the old version.
- **`PATH`.** When the link's directory isn't on `PATH`, the installer prints a line for the person to add.
- **Agents.** Agents and terminals inherit the server's `PATH`, which has `t3` only if the person's shell provides it.
- **The desktop app.** It keeps a launcher for its bundled CLI in the T3 home, and its Settings has a "t3 command" row whose Install button links that launcher onto `PATH`. Its agents still have `t3` only if the person's shell provides it.

**J5:**

- **The executable is `j5`.** The command, the file it runs, and the process are all `j5`. Archive file names keep upstream's `t3-<version>-<platform>` names.
- **Existing servers are moved once, by hand.** The rename is launcher protocol 4. A server from before it is refused the update from the app with a message to run `j5 update` on its machine; that command installs the new version and replaces the service's launcher. Each archive carries a `t3` link to `j5` so those servers can run that check and that command.
- **The command follows the service.** When the background service's server starts as the committed version, after an update or any restart, it repoints the installer's `~/.local/bin/j5` at itself.
- **The installer puts it on `PATH`.** When `~/.local/bin` isn't on `PATH`, the installer adds one marked line to the shell's startup file (zsh, bash, or fish) that puts the directory last, and `j5 uninstall` removes it. A profile it can't write gets the printed hint instead, and `J5CODE_NO_MODIFY_PATH` skips the edit.
- **Agents get the server's own `j5`.** A release server keeps `<home>/bin/j5` pointed at itself, and every server that finds a `j5` there puts `<home>/bin` first on the `PATH` its agents and terminals inherit.
- **The desktop app uses upstream's launcher, renamed.** At every launch the packaged app writes a launcher for its bundled CLI to `<home>/bin/j5`, which its server then puts first for its agents. It leaves the person's own `PATH` alone unless they ask: Settings → General → About has upstream's row, titled "j5 command", whose Install button links the launcher into a folder on `PATH` and whose Remove button takes it off again.

**Why:**

- **The name.** J5 shouldn't point at `t3` at all. With the old name, `~/.local/bin/j5` ran a file called `t3` and the server showed up as `t3`, which is confusing next to an installed T3 Code. Archive names stay, because existing servers download updates by those names and people never see them.
- **The one-time step.** An update from the app never replaces the service's launcher, and an old launcher starts every new version as `t3`. Shipping a `t3` link indefinitely would leave the migration unfinished, and removing it later would break those servers. Refusing the update with a clear message moves each server and its launcher across together.
- **Following updates.** On the dogfood box the command ran 0.0.44 while the service ran 0.0.47, so agents called a CLI three versions behind their server (#398). Upstream has the same gap with `t3`; the fix is in the give-back backlog (#276).
- **The installer and `PATH`.** A stock macOS shell doesn't have `~/.local/bin` on `PATH`, so a fresh install's `j5` wasn't found until the person edited their profile (#397). Jackson chose a profile line over linking into `/usr/local/bin`, which needs an admin prompt and a root-owned file the server couldn't repoint.
- **Agents.** An agent that can't find `j5` tends to work around it without saying so. Giving every agent its server's CLI, whatever the person's shell setup, removes that failure. The directory is J5's own and holds only `j5`, so it can go first without shadowing anything, including an installed T3 Code's `t3`.
- **The desktop app.** Agents were the actual problem, and they don't need the person's shell changed. J5 first built its own launcher and a command-palette install for the person's terminal. Upstream then shipped the same two things, so J5 took upstream's and renamed them. That moved the install from the command palette to Settings, and upstream's Install adds no line to a shell startup file.

**Consequences:**

- **One visit per existing server.** Each server on 0.0.47 or earlier needs `j5 update` run on its machine. It keeps running its old version until then.
- **The launcher reads protocol-3 state files.** The old CLI's `j5 update` writes one before starting the new launcher. This is a second line in upstream's `serviceProtocol.ts`.
- **The `t3` link is temporary.** Removing it is tracked in #440. After that, a server still on 0.0.47 or earlier gets a generic install error and needs the installer and `j5 service install`.
- **No downgrade across the rename.** Downgrading below the rename with `j5 update --allow-downgrade` isn't supported.
- **Only the default link is repointed.** The repoint covers only the installer's default link, `~/.local/bin/j5`, and only when it already points into the home's runtime. A link placed elsewhere stays where it is.
- **One `j5` per home for agents.** If two servers share a home, the last one started owns `<home>/bin/j5`.
- **The app no longer replaces a `j5` it did not write.** J5's own launcher overwrote whatever was at `<home>/bin/j5`. Upstream's leaves a file it didn't write. When a release server shares the app's home, its link stays, and the app's agents run the server's `j5`.
- **`j5 uninstall` can leave an app-installed link.** It knows the `~/.local/bin/j5` link; upstream's Install can link into other folders on `PATH`. Settings → Remove takes it off.
- **`j5 service status` asks for a repair after an update from the app.** The service's unit still names the launcher it was installed with, and the now-current `j5` reports that as needing `j5 service install`. That is accurate: running it replaces the launcher, with a restart. An agent that follows the suggestion restarts its own server. Keeping the launcher current is a separate improvement.
- **`j5 uninstall` removes the `PATH` line only with its command.** The installer's link and its line go when the link belongs to the home being uninstalled, so uninstalling another home, such as an agent's scratch home, leaves them.
- **A terminal can still find another `j5` first.** The directory is first for what the server starts directly. A shell that re-reads the person's profile can put their own directories, and a `j5` in them, ahead again.
- **At each advance:** check new upstream code that locates the executable by name, upstream's `SERVICE_LAUNCHER_PROTOCOL` (J5's number must stay above it), and that the startup hook still runs after `prepareTrial`.

**Decided:** Jackson, 2026-10-02 (#403), 2026-10-03 (the protocol bump and the `j5 update` step; #398; #397, including leaving the person's `PATH` alone in the Mac app), 2026-10-04 (#441, in the command palette only) and 2026-10-08 (upstream's launcher and Settings row, renamed, which revises the palette-only ruling). Recorded in FORK.md cases 50 to 53 and 57; cases 54 and 55 are retired.

#### D29. A client refuses a J5 server whose ledger has not been re-keyed

**Upstream:** a client connects to any server that speaks its orchestration protocol version.

**J5:** the same, with one refusal. A J5 server from before the ledger was re-keyed to projects is refused, with upstream's own message: "This client requires a newer server. Update the server on <name> to connect." The client recognizes it by the old ledger capability it reports.

**Why:** the client's Fleet, Inbox and thread cards read a project-keyed ledger. Against a J5 server that has not been updated they would show nothing, with no error. Refusing says what to do.

**Consequences:** a J5 server, the desktop app and the mobile app have to be updated together when this ships. Nothing changes for upstream's own servers: a server with no J5 ledger, plain T3 Code included, connects as it always has, and the J5 views report that source as unsupported. The other direction has no gate, because closing it would mean changing upstream's protocol version number, which would collide at the next advance. An older client still connects to a newer J5 server, and the server tells it that its Fleet, Inbox and Crew requests are not supported there, so it shows them as unsupported and reads nothing. Two things in an older client are not covered. A person on one cannot see or approve a Crew roster until they update, because the proposal does not appear above the composer. And archiving a thread warns that it could not check the thread's open work; the server still refuses to archive a single Crew member, but the older client no longer explains why.

**Decided:** in the plan to retire Squadrons ([#412](https://github.com/Jacksondr5/j5code/issues/412)): a strict version gate for clients, narrowed on 2026-10-08 to J5 servers only. Recorded in FORK.md case 56.

### Awaiting a decision

These already diverge on `j5/main`, but no human ruling is on record. Each landed as an implementer's call inside a merged PR. The person rules on each one; an approved entry moves up into its section, and a rejected one becomes a fix.

#### D22. Agent-spawned threads move under their spawner in the sidebar

**Upstream:** every thread except provider subagents appears in the sidebar.

**J5:** an agent-spawned Peer Agent, Crew seats included, leaves the top level of the sidebar unless pinned, and appears in the expander under the agent that spawned it.

**Why:** once agents spawn agents, a flat list stops telling the truth about what is running (Bryant, #205).

**Consequences:** this differs from the Fleet page definition (AC3: nothing is hidden from the sidebar because of how it was created), though the agent stays one click away in the expander rather than hidden. Jackson set aside the original rule (SB5) on 2026-09-04, because he has the Director spawn most of the agents he talks to. The Crews definition hides only Crew members. Pinning a spawned agent from its own thread brings it back to the top level.

**Status:** reintroduced in PR #149 (Bryant), approved in review on 2026-09-21 without a ruling on this point. Depends on the human-contact spectrum discussion (#336): which agents belong in the sidebar follows from where they sit on that spectrum.

### To be removed

The person ruled against these. They still diverge on `j5/main` until their fix lands, and then move to Retired.

#### D24. Astra model aliases

**Upstream:** no short aliases for `gpt-6-astra`.

**J5:** `astra`, `gpt-6` and `6` resolve to `gpt-6-astra`.

**Why:** to mirror the Fable aliases that existed at the time, which upstream has since removed.

**Consequences:** D4's Astra exception checks the resolved name, so removing the aliases needs checking against it.

**Status:** introduced in PR #101 (2026-09-04), merged on the Director's authority. To be removed in favor of upstream (#342). Recorded in FORK.md case 32.

### Retired

#### D10. Welcome wizard assigns imported conversations a Squadron

J5 added a fourth stage to upstream's welcome wizard that gave each imported folder's conversations a Squadron home (Jackson, 2026-09-17, PR #178). Retired 2026-10-04 in the plan to retire Squadrons ([#412](https://github.com/Jacksondr5/j5code/issues/412)): the wizard has upstream's three stages again. Imported conversations register in their project like every other thread since the ledger re-keyed to projects (2026-10-07).

#### D8. Acting on another agent also requires a shared Squadron

On top of upstream's same-project rule, J5 required a shared Squadron to archive or unarchive another agent and to merge back (Jackson, 2026-09-28). Retired 2026-10-07, when the ledger re-keyed to projects ([#412](https://github.com/Jacksondr5/j5code/issues/412)): a thread's home is its project, so upstream's same-project rule was the only rule. Upstream has since dropped that rule for thread tools, and J5 follows it (D2).

#### D9. A thread's Squadron is created for it

A thread launched without a Squadron registered into its project's Squadron, which the server created when the project had none (Jackson, 2026-10-03). Retired 2026-10-07 ([#412](https://github.com/Jacksondr5/j5code/issues/412)): there are no Squadrons. Every thread except a provider Subagent is a participant in its own project's ledger from the moment it exists, and a server that upgrades registers the threads it already has. A rule the Squadron definition held beside this entry, that the platform never creates an unnamed default container ("no junk drawer"), is reversed by name: J5 accepts upstream's "No project" project as upstream ships it, one per environment for threads started without a project (Jackson, 2026-10-05). It arrives with the next upstream advance and is no divergence.

#### D11. A scheduled task can't start a thread in a project that several Squadrons share

A scheduled run was refused before creating a thread when several Squadrons referenced its project (narrowed to that case on 2026-10-03). Retired 2026-10-07 ([#412](https://github.com/Jacksondr5/j5code/issues/412)): a scheduled task starts a fresh thread as it does upstream.

#### D5. A committed Stop wins over a racing steer

Once a Stop was committed, J5 kept a steer the provider had accepted before it from starting a new turn. It arrived with the 2026-09-17 upstream integration and Jackson kept it on 2026-09-24. Jackson ruled on 2026-09-28 that controlling a thread's turns is upstream's area and this is a race J5 doesn't design for. Removed 2026-10-08 ([#343](https://github.com/Jacksondr5/j5code/issues/343)): J5 runs upstream's code. Upstream's Stop holds the thread's queue, which covers queued messages; a peer steer already in flight to an Astra agent can still wake it (D4).

#### D7. Codex CLI version floor

J5 refused Codex CLIs older than 0.151.0 with a named error, because older CLIs omitted fields the schema required (PR #92, 2026-09-04; approved by Jackson on 2026-09-28). Retired 2026-10-08 (Jackson): J5 follows upstream's provider compatibility table, which warns about a version and doesn't block it. J5 reads that table with the upstream version it is based on, because J5 keeps its own version numbers (FORK.md case 59).

#### D15. Archive Undo is withheld when Crews may retire

J5 hid Undo on an archive that might retire a Captain's Crews, because unarchiving the Captain didn't bring them back (Jackson, 2026-09-24). Retired in [#312](https://github.com/Jacksondr5/j5code/issues/312), when unarchiving a Captain began restoring its Crews (D14): every archive door offers upstream's Undo again. This register listed the entry as live until 2026-10-08.

#### D23. A committed Stop also blocks usage-limit auto-resume

J5 kept a run from resuming after a usage-limit reset when the person had pressed Stop on it first. It was added during the 2026-09-24 advance without its own decision, as an extension of D5. Jackson ruled on 2026-09-28 that it is an edge case J5 doesn't design for. Removed 2026-10-08 ([#343](https://github.com/Jacksondr5/j5code/issues/343)) with D5.

## History

- 2026-09-26 — created: the three zones, the decision protocol, and the register, seeded from FORK.md and the worklog records (Jackson, [#327](https://github.com/Jacksondr5/j5code/issues/327)).
- 2026-10-04 — D25 added: user-visible copy, marks and branch names (PR #445).
- 2026-10-04 — D26 added: `j5 triage` points at J5's repository (PR #446).
- 2026-10-04 — D28 added: the `j5` command (PR #414).
- 2026-10-07 — D8, D9 and D11 retired and D29 added: the ledger re-keyed to projects ([#412](https://github.com/Jacksondr5/j5code/issues/412)).
- 2026-10-08 — D9 records the accepted reversal of "no junk drawer": upstream's "No project" project is taken as upstream ships it (Jackson, 2026-10-05; [#412](https://github.com/Jacksondr5/j5code/issues/412)).
- 2026-10-08 — the advance onto upstream `main`: D5, D7 and D23 retired, D15 recorded as retired, D8's retired text corrected, and D1, D2, D3, D4, D6, D14, D19, D25 and D28 rewritten for what upstream now ships (Jackson's decisions of that day).
