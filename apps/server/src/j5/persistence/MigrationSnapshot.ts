 * copy. A database with no history is new and is not copied; neither is one with nothing pending,
 * so an ordinary start costs two small reads.
 *
 * The copy uses SQLite's backup API, which reads through the WAL and never writes to the source.
 * It is published only if it still records the same migrations, so a copy taken after another
 * process already migrated never replaces a real snapshot. It replaces an older snapshot of the
 * same name, and the oldest snapshots beyond `MIGRATION_SNAPSHOTS_KEPT` are then deleted.
 *
 * Interrupting it waits for the copy in progress, which cannot be abandoned, then removes it.
