/**
 * A seat tells its Captain when it finishes: when a member's run ends and it owes no reply to
 * anyone, the platform posts a notice into the Captain's thread with how the run ended, as
 * measured facts, and where the seat's handoff stands. The seat's thread is otherwise left as
 * upstream leaves any thread; nothing here settles it (Jackson's review, 2026-09-17: upstream
 * settles by hand, by merged PR, or by three idle days, and a seat marked settled seconds after
 * launch read as wrong). A later inbound message starts a new run as usual. Captains are never
 * reported on here because they keep coordinating after their own turns end.
 *
 * A member whose definition declares an output artifact writes it as its handoff file, the same
 * shared artifact every saved agent produces; the handoff gate (agentHandoffObserver) checks for
 * it and reminds the seat once. The notice carries the file inline when it exists and is short,
 * so a seat finishing is one message to the Captain, not two.
 *
 * Two rules keep the Captain's queue short (Bryant, 2026-09-14). A notice is posted the first time
 * a seat finishes and again only when its facts changed; a finish whose notice would read exactly
 * like the last one is silent, because the seat's own reply already reached the Captain. And a
 * notice that arrives while the Captain's turn is running folds into the seat notice already
 * queued behind that turn, so the Captain absorbs its Crew's news in one turn, not one per seat.
