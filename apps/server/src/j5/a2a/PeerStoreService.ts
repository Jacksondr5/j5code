 * the poller tells about itself (its name, capabilities, protocol version and,
 * when it changed, its roster), and takes the next batch of messages stored
 * for it. With nothing waiting the poll is held until a message for this peer
 * is committed or the hold ends, which stays under typical office-proxy idle
 * timeouts. A poll is taken in two steps, so the route can answer its status
 * at once and hold only the body: `startPoll` records the poll, and the answer
 * it returns is the held batch.
