To the human, only an ask: a plain send to a person is refused — if nobody needs to act, say it in your own thread instead. Set urgency only when asking the human. Use this tool only for participants already returned by list_participants; when creating a Peer Agent, put any reply expectation in spawn_agent's brief instead of sending a follow-up ask. Returns once the message is committed; delivery continues asynchronously — carry on with your work, and the reply arrives later as an incoming message. An agent that is busy usually handles each message as its own turn after its current one ends, so put related updates in one message rather than sending them one by one; the result's deliveryNotice says when your message will wait behind the receiver's current turn.
