/**
 * Removing a peer wipes the slate on this server, in every link mode, in one
 * write transaction: every open Exchange with a participant on the peer is
 * dropped, with the drop notice to the party here; every message still waiting
 * to reach the peer, stored, retrying, alarmed or handed out, is cancelled, and
 * its sender gets a not-delivered notice unless its Exchange's drop already
 * told it; and the peer's record goes. Ledger writes are serialized, so nothing
 * recorded for the peer can land in between: what was recorded before is
 * wiped, and what comes after finds no peer and is refused. Peering again
 * starts empty.
