 * Fleet page use, with the person's act as the confirmation, and records that they retired with
 * the Captain so its unarchive brings them back; settle and unsettle are sent to each seat.
 * Command ids derive from the Captain, the Crew, the seat, and the occurrence (the event, or the
 * Captain's archive time on the sweep), so a replayed event converges on the same commands while
 * an archive after an unarchive gets commands of its own. Each Crew's step runs once; a failure is
