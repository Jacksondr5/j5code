# J5 A2A runtime configuration

`envelopes.v1.json` is the human-owned wording source for every injected A2A envelope and the two MCP tool descriptions. Templates use literal `{{name}}` placeholders; `EnvelopeFormatter.ts` is the only renderer. Change wording in the JSON file, keep every referenced placeholder, and bump `version` when the rendered contract changes.

`delivery-config.v1.json` owns the retry backoff and alarm threshold. Attempts reuse one upstream command/message id pair derived from the durable ledger message id. Increasing an attempt never rotates those ids: a permanently rejected upstream receipt must become a visible alarm rather than risk a second injection.

Agent-side epic bootstrap is deliberately explicit through the authenticated `join_epic` MCP tool. `send_message` and `list_participants` never auto-join. Human/UI epic creation, selection, and management belong to the item-4 surface milestone and are not part of A2.

For a cross-epic send, the receiver ledger's idempotent `message.received` records durable acceptance of the sender's act before transport is attempted. It does not claim successful thread injection: delivery success, retries, and the terminal alarm remain in the sender epic's delivery projection.

Byte-equivalent rebuilds for the A2 exchange and delivery projections are deferred to the measured-projections milestone (M5). A2 keeps those tables derivable from the communication ledger but does not expose their rebuild operation.
