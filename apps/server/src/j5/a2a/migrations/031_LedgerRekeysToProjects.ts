// project id. Every Squadron referenced exactly one project, so each ledger moves to that
// project's id unchanged: no row is added, removed or renumbered.

// The Squadron table is re-keyed and renamed in place and never dropped. With foreign keys on,
// dropping it would run ON DELETE CASCADE on nine child tables, and `defer_foreign_keys` does
// not hold a cascade back. Renaming also lets SQLite rewrite every child's foreign key itself.
