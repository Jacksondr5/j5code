 * A playbook run can follow a Crew, and every step it lands on is handed to the seat that owns
 * it. One delivery row per landing (start, next, back, reselect), keyed by the request that
 * caused it, so a retried request never delivers twice. Delivery rows are not tied to
 * `j5_playbook_request`, whose prune trigger drops movement requests when a run ends; they stay
 * as the audit trail and as what `j5_playbook_current` and Fleet read.
