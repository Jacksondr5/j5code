 * peer for the messages it stores here. Each poll acknowledges the previous
 * batch, sends this server's roster when it changed, and records each delivery
 * through the inbound service exactly as the deliver route does, one at a time
 * and in order. Messages this server sends to the peer still go directly.
 *
 * The loop is the heartbeat: the storing server answers a poll's headers as
 * soon as it arrives, so it sees this server present at least once per hold
 * while it runs, and this server stamps its own last poll when those headers
 * arrive. A roster change
 * abandons the poll in flight, so the peer learns of an archive or a rename at
