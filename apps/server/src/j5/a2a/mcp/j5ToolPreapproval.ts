/**
 * The t3-code tools Codex and Claude pre-approve so the roster gate stays the only human step there.
 * Harnesses gate every MCP tool that is not annotated read-only behind an approval prompt, and a
 * turn whose approval policy is `never` (Codex 0.153+: "MCP tool call requires approval, but
 * approval policy is never") rejects the call outright. Full-access mode and every saved-agent
 * runtime policy send exactly that, so without help `j5_send_message`, `j5_spawn_agent`, and
 * `j5_propose_crew` all fail there. Only the J5 verbs are pre-approved, by name: their handlers
 * authorize each call and their real gates live server-side, plus `j5_write_artifact`, which a saved
 * agent needs for its declared handoff file (application storage, never the workspace), plus the
 * provider-native Subagent verbs (`delegate_task`, `task_status`, `task_cancel`): a Crew member is
 * refused `j5_spawn_agent` and told to run its own helpers as Subagents, so those must work under
 * the same policy, and a child inherits its parent's sandbox through the escalation check. The
 * rest of the t3-code server (worktree handoff, browser preview, scheduling) keeps the harness's
 * own verdict, so a read-only persona under `never` still cannot reach those. Kept as a leaf
 * module (no toolkit import) so adapters avoid a cycle; the test checks the list against
 * J5Toolkit.
