/**
 * Records `j5.turn.started` for every run the orchestrator creates, saying who asked for it.
 *
 * Upstream's `client.turn.requested` fires only for a message a person sends over a client
 * socket. A turn started by an agent's message, an Inbox reply, a spawn brief, a Crew notice, a
 * playbook step or a scheduled task never passes through that handler, and
 * `provider.turn.completed` does not say who asked. This reads the committed `run.created`
 * event instead, which every path writes exactly once, so retried commands are not counted twice.
