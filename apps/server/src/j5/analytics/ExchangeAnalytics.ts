/**
 * Records `j5.exchange.closed` when an Exchange ends, saying how it ended and how long it was
 * open. An Exchange is an ask the receiver owes a reply to, so this is the measure of whether
 * asks get answered, by whom, and how long one waits on the person.
 *
 * It reads the ledger's committed events, which are published once per commit, so a retried
 * reply, withdrawal or archive counts once.
