 * only `j5`, so agents normally get the CLI of the server running them and
 * nothing else on PATH is shadowed. (A shell that re-reads the person's

 * desktop app writes its own script there before it starts this server, so
 * the PATH step runs for every server that finds a `j5` in that directory. A
