/**
 * The handoff check. After each completed run of a saved-agent task whose definition declares an
 * output artifact, look for the expected file in the shared artifacts. Present: record `written`.
 * Absent the first time: record `nudged` and queue one follow-up message asking the agent to write
 * it. Absent on any later run: record `missing`; the reminder is never repeated.
 *
 * This does not gate the parent. `RunFinalizationService.finalize` commits the run's completion,
 * and with it the delegated completion that wakes the parent, before it calls this observer, so
 * the parent has already been told the child finished when the reminder is queued. The reminder
 * starts a follow-up run in the child's own thread; the recorded status is what the person sees.
 * Wraps the upstream observer so the refresh behavior it owns is preserved.
