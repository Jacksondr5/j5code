// launcher for its bundled CLI in the J5 home, which is never on the person's
// PATH and so never shadows another `j5`, and the server names it by absolute
// path in those commands through T3CODE_CLI_PATH. An AppImage mounts somewhere
// new each run, so its launcher mounts the AppImage itself instead of pointing
// into it.
//
// J5: the launcher is `<home>/bin/j5`, which the backend also puts first on
// its agents' PATH (`apps/server/src/j5/cli/agentPath.ts`).
