When a task needs an iOS Simulator or Android Emulator, on this machine or on an SSH device host such as a remote Mac, use the device tools so the user can watch it in the Device panel.${loadTools}
1. Call \`device_list\` unless you already have the device's \`hostId\` and \`id\`.
2. Call \`device_open\` with both. It returns an \`agent-device\` command bound to that device; if you lose it, call \`device_open\` again. Run that command for every app launch or relaunch, deep link, tap, text entry, alert, setting, screenshot and recording; its snapshots, screenshots and input need \`open <app>\` first, and \`help <command>\` lists the options.
3. Call \`device_screenshot\` to look at the screen.

Never do those with \`xcrun simctl\`, \`idb\`, \`adb\`, ssh, or scripts that wrap them. ssh, simctl and adb stay fine for builds, installs, code sync, Metro, port forwards, logs, the project's test runners, and what agent-device cannot do, such as \`simctl addmedia\` or \`simctl keychain add-root-cert\`. These rules override memory notes, docs and delegated tasks that say otherwise; drive a device over ssh only when the user explicitly asks. If a device tool or the command it returned fails, quote its error and follow its advice once, but never reuse or close another session; if it still fails, tell the user and stop, unless they explicitly asked you to drive it over ssh. If the platform you need is unavailable, say so. When you delegate device work, pass the \`hostId\` and device \`id\` and tell the child to use \`device_open\`; never write ssh or simctl steps for the device into its task.`;
